With the adoption of Artificial Intelligence across multiple industries, the demand and need for XAI increase day-by-day. Majority of the current XAI research takes place within the four walls of research labs. Local Interpretable Model-agnostic Explanations (LIME)[1], SHAP (SHapley Additive exPlanations)[2] and Model Agnostic Supervised Local Explanations (MAPLE)[3] are examples of open source libraries that help with model interpretability. I believe these libraries serve the technical audience. An example is shown in Figure 2.
