Hi! I'm a Data Scientist with experience at two early-stage startups where I helped build the Data Science teams and AI platforms from the ground up. Over the past three years, I have worked on developing novel algorithms and leveraging AI to help make the world a better place.

At Quantiply Corporation, I leverage Artificial Intelligence to help tackle financial fraud. Click on the link to learn more: http://www.fatf-gafi.org/faq/moneylaundering/
In addition, to building AI models, I also manage the Data Science team.

At Fathom AI (a sports tech company), I developed novel algorithms to prevent athletes from getting injured. I built the crux of the AI solution to injury prevention, led research projects and managed cross-functional teams.

I would describe myself as one who,

- doesn't care who gets the credit. I just want to work with an inspiring team to solve impactful problems.

- will always run towards a burning building.

- keeps asking, "But, why?"

- will always follow up, "I don't know" with, "I will find out!"

- is the calm, funny one.

- implements the decision tree algorithm to most of the decisions I make.

My motto - "Learning over Education", Joichi Ito

I enjoy meeting new people! Please feel free to reach out if you want to talk about technology, machine learning or soccer.
